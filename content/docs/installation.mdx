### Using NPX (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to scaffold a new project without installing anything globally:

```bash
npx create-ex-app my-app
```

### Global Installation

If you prefer using the CLI multiple times or want quicker access, install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g create-ex-app
```

### Start Your Application

Once the project is created:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your application will be running at:
http://localhost:4000
